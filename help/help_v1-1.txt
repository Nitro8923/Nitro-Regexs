    Path to new file: 

The re files are stored in the re folder. in the re folder, you can see re.txt with your regexs.
you can edit re.txt manually to get regexes as well.

You can make a new file or import a .txt file with regexs in rows, where each regex is a line.
Enter in the path to your new file and you will get back to the menu.

IMPORTANT: If you import another file other than a txt file, your program will crash everytime you run it. To fix the file error, go to re_search.txt in the main directory
and edit the path.

If you entered anything else your program will interpret it as you exiting the program.
